It is a codeigniter based project and fully functional.
It is a completely dynamic website.
In this project there are two login credentials one is for principle and other is for teacher.
Whereas Principle(admin) has the access to manage/update/delete/add teacher or student and also have access to change the school name, so school name is also generating dynamic.
And in teacher side teacher can only manage/update/delete/add the student, teacher don't have authorization of managing teachers. Teacher cannot change the school name either.
there are also a search bar so it helps to find the specifc data from the database. As everything is comming form the server.
To create this project I use javascript, codeigniter framework and jquery too.

. you can check out this project by running on the server localhost/schools
and it would through back to login page if your login details is incorrect.
